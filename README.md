# A-Path-Finding-
We will be building a path finding visualizer tool to visualize the a star pathfinding algorithm as it runs. This astar pathfinding algorithm is an informed search algorithm which means it is much more efficient that your standard algorithms like breadth first search or depth first search.

Highlights
Implementation of a class to visualize grid and obstacles 🟦
Setting up nodes with different colors for start, end, barriers, and paths 🎨
Handling mouse clicks to set start, end, and barriers ⌨️
Starting pathfinding algorithm with space key press ⏯️
Algorithm finds shortest path by considering all possible nodes 🛤️
Reconstructing path by tracing back from end to start node 🔍
Ability to reset program by pressing ‘c’ to clear screen ♻️
Key Insights
The visualization tool allows for a clear representation of the grid and obstacles, making it easier to understand the pathfinding process 🧩
The algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path by exploring all possible nodes and updating the shortest distance accordingly 🚀
The ability to reset the program provides users with a convenient way to start over or make changes to the grid 🔄
